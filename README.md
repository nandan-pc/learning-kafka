[100 Days of Code with Apache KafkaÂ®](https://developer.confluent.io/100-days-of-code/)


Day 1: 
  - Set up simple Kafka Cluster in [Confluent Cloud](https://developer.confluent.io/quickstart/kafka-on-confluent-cloud/) , created a topic, and produced and consumed hello world message! 
  - Set up [python client](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python) on local complete and ran basic producer and consumer program.  
  
Day 2: 
  - [Events](https://developer.confluent.io/learn-kafka/apache-kafka/events/)
    - What is an event ? 
    - Event structure in Kafka i.e. Key/Value pair


Day 3: 
  - [Topics](https://developer.confluent.io/learn-kafka/apache-kafka/topics/) 
    - Topic is fundamental unit of organization of events
    - A topic is a log of events.
    - Logs are simple datastructures with following symantics
      - They are append only When you write a new message into a log, it always goes on the end.
      - They can only be read by seeking an arbitrary offset in the log, then by scanning sequential log entries
      - events in the log are immutable i.e. once something has happened, it is exceedingly difficult to make it un-happen.  
    - Topic is not same as Queue. In Topic data is retained(possibly indefinately). Where as in Queue it is not.(deque operation)  

Day 4:
  - [The Log: What every software engineer should know about real-time data's unifying abstraction](https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying) 
    - Part 1: 
      - What is a log ? 
      - Logs in Database : Write ahead log (for Durability - ACID)
      - Logs in Distributed System
        - "State Machine Replication Principle: If two identical, deterministic processes begin in the same state and get the same inputs in the same order, they will produce the same output and end in the same state." 
        - state machine model: Active-Active mode of usage of log
        - primary-backup model: Active-Passive mode of usage of log      
  - [Partitions](https://developer.confluent.io/learn-kafka/apache-kafka/partitions/)
    - What is partitioning of a topic ? 
    - How events are distributed among partition for a topic ?  
      - Round robin method for events with no key
      - Hashing for events with key
    - [How to choose the number of topics/partitions in a Kafka cluster?](https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-choose-number-topics-partitions-kafka-cluster/)
